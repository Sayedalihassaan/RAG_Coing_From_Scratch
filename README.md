# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from Scratch

This project demonstrates a **from-scratch implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — a powerful technique that combines **information retrieval** and **natural language generation** to produce accurate and context-aware responses. It is inspired by the architecture used in advanced language models such as GPT and BERT-based retrievers.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom implementation of RAG pipeline using Python
- End-to-end workflow: document indexing, query retrieval, and answer generation
- Vector-based document retrieval using embeddings
- Integration with a transformer-based generative model
- Clear and educational notebook format for learning purposes

## 📦 Requirements

To run this notebook, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install datasets
pip install sentence-transformers
````

> Note: `faiss-cpu` is required for efficient vector search.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-from-Scratch.git
   cd RAG-from-Scratch
   ```

2. Install the required packages listed above.

3. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RAG_Coing_From_Scratch.ipynb
   ```

## 📌 Usage

The notebook walks you through:

* Loading and chunking a document corpus
* Generating vector embeddings for documents
* Using FAISS for nearest-neighbor search
* Retrieving relevant chunks based on a query
* Feeding results into a language model for generation

## 📚 Example

```python
query = "What is retrieval-augmented generation?"
# System retrieves relevant chunks and generates an answer based on them.
```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Dense vector retrieval
* FAISS indexing
* Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT)
* Text chunking and embedding
* Prompt engineering basics
